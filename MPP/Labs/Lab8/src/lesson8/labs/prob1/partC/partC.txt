interface Comparator<T> { 
   int compare(T o1, T o2);
}

Interface Comparator is called a functional interface because it has just one (abstract) method.

An implementation of a functional interface is called a functor.

A closure is a functor embedded inside another class, that is capable of remembering the state 
of its enclosing object. In Java 7, instances of member, local, and anonymous inner classes are
(essentially) closures, since they have full access to their enclosing object’s state.
